## IAM as a Company

### 1. **User** = Employee
- A person with a badge (**login/password** or **access key**).
- Can work alone, but itâ€™s better to add them to a **Group**.
- Can receive permissions directly, but that gets messy.

### 2. **Group** = Department
- A collection of users (e.g., "Developers").
- Policies are attached to the group, and all users inherit those permissions.
- **Recommended best practice**.

### 3. **Role** = Temporary Role or Visitor Badge
- Not tied to any specific person.
- It is **assumed temporarily** by a user, service, or external identity.
- Used by **EC2, Lambda**, etc., to interact with AWS securely. (Services)
- Policies define what the Role can do.

### 4. **Policy** = Access Manual (in JSON)
- A document that defines **permissions** (e.g., "can read/write to S3").
- Types of policies:
  - **AWS Managed**: Prebuilt by AWS
  - **Customer Managed**: Created by you (recommended)
  - **Inline**: Attached directly to a user/group/role (avoid unless really needed)

## Who Can Have What?

| Entity    | Can Have Policy? | Recommended?           | Best Practice                                     |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **User**  |  Yes           |  Avoid              | Use **Groups** instead of attaching directly      |
| **Group** |  Yes           |  Yes                | Attach reusable policies to the group             |
| **Role**  |  Yes           |  Yes                | Attach policies, then allow EC2/Lambda to assume  |
| **Service**|  No           |  No                 | Services must **assume a Role with permissions**  |

---

## Example 1: Developer Fernanda Needs EC2 and S3

 Correct:
- Create User **Fernanda**
- Create Group **Developers**
- Create Policy that allows EC2 and S3
- Attach Policy to Group
- Add Fernanda to the Group

 Wrong:
- Attach Policy directly to Fernanda

---

## Example 2: EC2 Accessing S3

 Correct:
- Create a **Role** with a Policy for S3 access
- Allow EC2 to assume the Role
- EC2 now inherits those permissions automatically

 Wrong:
- Create an IAM User and paste the access key into the EC2 machine

---

##  Policy Types

| Type                  | Use Case                                 | Reusable? | Recommended?     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| AWS Managed           | Prebuilt, quick start                     | Yes    |  Yes           |
| Customer Managed      | Custom, reusable                          |  Yes    |  **Best Choice**|
| Inline Policy         | One-off, specific use only                |  No     |  Only if needed |

---

##  Final Summary

- **Users**: People with permanent credentials. Avoid direct policies.
- **Groups**: Used to manage permissions for multiple users.  Recommended.
- **Roles**: Used by AWS services or external users. Always have policies.
- **Policies**: JSON documents that define permissions.

# AWS Console

## Create a User
</br>

---

### Details of User

**Click on User**

</br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a41e7b9-5444-43b4-947c-26f9653976e4)

</br>

_> In this case, as the change password flag has been marked, on the first access of the user he will have to change the password_

-----

</br>

Notice in the panel on the Permissions tab, that it has a Directly Attached policy. That is, it is not because it is part of a group but yes, because this policy was linked to it atuomaticamente by default when the user was created

And hereâ€™s a very important note: 

_> ðŸ’¡ **Highly** | When we talk about attaching permissions to a user, group or role. Weâ€™re talking about **policies**! When someone talks about attaching permissions to a group/user we are talking indirectly about **policies**._


## Create a Group

</br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a7e4a5a-1c1b-490c-8bc0-85e653469bbb)

----

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/335d51dd-bcab-419e-8094-78d9bb611522)

</br>

_> In this case you can already put a user in the group creation or attach that user later. No matter_

----

### Details of Group

Here we can see details of the group, such as who is part of the group and what permissions (policies)

</br>

### Attach policy to a group

----

### Users in the group

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a4deedb-09a4-4579-b389-deaee98aab8a)


_> Notice that the user has policies applied to himself directly and others that are inherited through the group_

----



## Policies

_> One thing that has to be clear here, is that the basic organization of the Policy is as follows: **Policy -> Service -> Permission**. Letâ€™s go back to the example of the policy that was assigned to the user group, "AmazonS3FullAccess"._
</br>


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d0b1920-553f-46fa-99c6-84a3f7a7bdfe)

----

_> If we click on the policy we can see that it has two services: S3 and S3 Object Lambda_

</br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0476c9b-0210-4049-9d49-af283734b8e6)

----

</br>

_> And clicking on these services, S3 for example, we will see the permissions associated with them:_
